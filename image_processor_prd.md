## Core Features

### 1. Image Upload
Users can upload images in common formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) through a simple web interface. The platform supports both single image uploads and batch processing of multiple images.

### 2. Intelligent Resize (Optional)
Transform images to specific aspect ratios while preserving important visual elements using advanced AI-powered editing:

**Standard Resize Options:**
- Square format (1:1)
- Portrait (3:4) 
- Landscape (4:3)
- Widescreen (16:9)
- Story format (9:16)
- Custom aspect ratios

**AI-Powered Resize with Qwen Image Edit:**
- **Intelligent Object-Aware Resizing**: Uses Qwen-VL2 model to understand image content and intelligently resize while preserving key subjects
- **Context-Preserving Cropping**: AI identifies and maintains important visual elements during aspect ratio changes
- **Smart Background Extension**: Automatically generates coherent background content when expanding canvas size
- **Content-Aware Scaling**: Maintains visual balance and composition through AI-guided transformations
- **Text-Driven Modifications**: Users can provide specific instructions for resize behavior (e.g., "Keep the person centered", "Extend the sky background")
- **Multiple Variation Generation**: Creates up to 4 different resize options for user selection
- **Quality-Controlled Output**: Configurable generation parameters ensure optimal image quality
