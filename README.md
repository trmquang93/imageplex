## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Navigate to the web-app directory:
   ```bash
   cd web-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint (when configured)

## Usage

1. **Upload Images**: Drag and drop images onto the upload area or click to browse files
2. **Configure Processing**: Choose which processing steps to apply:
   - **Resize**: Transform to specific aspect ratios (A4, Square, Portrait, Landscape, etc.)
   - **Coloring**: AI-powered colorization with various artistic styles
   - **Line Art**: Convert photos to clean line drawings for coloring
   - **Line Thickness**: Reduce all lines to exactly 1-pixel width using morphological thinning

## Advanced Processing Features

### Line Thickness Reduction (Zhang-Suen Algorithm)

The line thickness reduction feature implements the Zhang-Suen morphological thinning algorithm to convert thick lines into single-pixel skeletons while preserving topology and connectivity.

**Key Features:**
- **Exact 1-pixel lines**: Reduces all strokes to exactly 1-pixel width
- **Topology preservation**: Maintains line connectivity and structure  
- **Configurable iterations**: Adjustable processing strength (1-20 iterations)
- **Output styles**: Black-on-white or white-on-black output
- **Endpoint preservation**: Optional setting to maintain line endpoints
- **Canvas-based processing**: No external API dependencies, fully self-contained

**Technical Implementation:**
- Pure JavaScript implementation of Zhang-Suen algorithm
- Server-side Canvas API processing using node-canvas
- Binary image conversion with configurable thresholding
- Morphological operations for skeleton extraction
- Real-time processing with comprehensive error handling

**Use Cases:**
- Converting hand-drawn sketches to clean digital lines
- Preparing line art for digital coloring applications
- Creating consistent stroke weights across artwork
- Processing scanned drawings for digital use

## Development

### Key Components

- **ImageStore**: Central state management for uploaded images and processing pipeline
- **useFileUpload**: Custom hook handling drag-and-drop file uploads
- **HeroSection**: Landing page hero with feature highlights
- **UploadSection**: File upload interface with drag-and-drop support

### Adding New Features

1. Create components in appropriate directories (`/components/features/`, `/components/ui/`)
2. Add types in `/types/index.ts`
3. Use Zustand store for state management
4. Follow existing patterns for styling and animations

### Styling Guidelines

- Use semantic CSS classes for component styling
- Follow utility-first approach for layouts and spacing
- Maintain consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes

## Performance

- **Fast Development**: Vite provides instant hot module replacement
- **Optimized Builds**: Automatic code splitting and tree shaking
- **Efficient State**: Zustand provides minimal re-renders
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and assets loaded on demand
