# Security Considerations

## FAL.AI API Key Usage - ✅ RESOLVED

### Current Implementation (Production Ready)
- ✅ **API key is secured server-side** - No client exposure
- ✅ **Proxy server implemented** - All FAL.AI calls go through secure API routes
- ✅ **Zero client-side credentials** - Frontend never accesses API keys directly
- ✅ **Production deployment ready** - Security best practices implemented

### Security Architecture
The application now uses a secure proxy server pattern:

#### Implemented Security Measures:
1. **Server-Side API Routes** (`/api/*`)
   - `/api/upload` - Secure file upload proxy
   - `/api/resize` - Intelligent resize processing
   - `/api/coloring` - AI coloring operations  
   - `/api/lineArt` - Line art conversion

2. **Environment Variable Protection**
   - API key stored as `FAL_API_KEY` in Vercel environment variables
   - No `.env` files in production deployment
   - Server-side only access to credentials

3. **Request Validation**
   - Server-side validation of all API requests
   - Proper error handling and sanitization
   - No direct client access to FAL.AI endpoints

### Security Benefits Achieved
- ✅ **Zero Credential Exposure**: API keys never sent to client
- ✅ **Request Control**: Server validates all requests before forwarding
- ✅ **Rate Limiting Ready**: Can implement usage controls at proxy level
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Centralized error processing prevents info leakage
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Server-side logging of all API usage

### Production Deployment Status
- ✅ All security vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ Ready for public deployment on Vercel
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure risk
- ✅ Follows industry security best practices

## File Upload Security
- Files are uploaded to FAL.AI storage (7-day retention)
- No permanent storage of user files in our application
- File URLs are temporary and auto-expire

## Environment Variables
- Keep `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- Use different API keys for different environments
- Rotate API keys regularly in production
